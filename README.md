# Potato-Disease-Classification-
Potato Disease Classification involves identifying and categorizing various diseases affecting potato plants using machine learning techniques. This process is crucial for agricultural productivity, as early detection and treatment of diseases can prevent significant crop losses.

Common Potato Diseases
1. Late Blight: Caused by the fungus *Phytophthora infestans*, leading to dark spots on leaves and tubers.
2. Early Blight: Caused by the fungus *Alternaria solani*, resulting in brown or black lesions on the leaves.
3. Potato Scab: Caused by the bacterium *Streptomyces scabies*, leading to rough, corky patches on the tubers.
4. Black Scurf: Caused by the fungus *Rhizoctonia solani*, forming black patches on the tuber surface.

Features Used for Classification
1. Color: The color of leaves, stems, and tubers can change based on the disease. For example, blight causes dark spots on leaves.
2. Texture: Scabs or rough patches on tubers can be indicators of certain diseases.
3. Shape: Changes in the shape of leaves or tubers might indicate specific diseases.
4. Size of Spots or Lesions: The size and spread of spots or lesions on the leaves are key indicators.
5. Vein Patterns: Certain diseases affect the vein patterns on leaves, which can be a useful feature.

Frameworks and Techniques
1. Data Collection:
   - Image Data: High-resolution images of leaves, stems, and tubers are collected.
   - Labeling: Data is labeled based on the disease type for supervised learning.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Image Augmentation: Techniques like rotation, scaling, and flipping to increase the diversity of training data.
   - Normalization: Adjusting pixel values to a standard range.
   - Segmentation: Separating the affected areas from the healthy parts in an image.

3. Feature Extraction:
   - CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks): Used for extracting features like edges, textures, and patterns from images.
   - Transfer Learning: Using pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet, or Inception to extract high-level features.

4. Modeling:
   - Deep Learning Models: CNNs are the most popular for image classification tasks.
   - Random Forest and SVM: These can be used for classification tasks when combined with hand-engineered features.
   - Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models to improve accuracy.

5. Evaluation Metrics:
   - Accuracy: Percentage of correctly classified images.
   - Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: To evaluate the performance on each class (each disease type).
   - Confusion Matrix: To see how well the model is distinguishing between different diseases.

6. Frameworks:
   - **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training deep learning models.
   - **PyTorch**: Another popular deep learning framework with dynamic computational graphs.
   - **OpenCV**: Useful for image processing and feature extraction tasks.
   - **Scikit-learn**: For traditional machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
   - **Fastai**: A high-level library built on PyTorch, specifically designed for quick model prototyping.

### **Workflow Example**:
1. **Data Collection**: Collect potato plant images from various sources, including diseased and healthy plants.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize images, apply augmentations, and possibly segment the affected regions.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Use a CNN model to extract features from the images.
4. **Model Training**: Train a deep learning model using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
5. **Evaluation**: Use evaluation metrics to assess the modelâ€™s performance.
6. **Deployment**: Deploy the model for real-time disease detection using mobile apps or web services.

This approach helps farmers and agricultural experts quickly and accurately diagnose potato diseases, leading to better crop management and reduced losses.
